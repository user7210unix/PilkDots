# Pilk's dotfiles

These are my current dotfiles.
A very clean look for hyprland. As well as my first ever rice ðŸ¤“

Most of these original config files were made by other [people](https://github.com/PilkDrinker/PilkDots?tab=readme-ov-file#original-work) in the community and then alterted by me.
A lot of the heavy work was made by [Stephan Raabe](https://github.com/mylinuxforwork) (ML4W) who made the inital dotfiles I edited.

Also a big thanks to [Ksawlii](https://github.com/Ksawlii) and [Thomas Brugman](https://github.com/Githubguy132010) for making the installation scripts! ðŸ’™

# Manual Installation

```

2. Clone the repository with:

```
git clone https://github.com/PilkDrinker/PilkDots.git
```
3. Move the .config, .themes, and wallpaper into your home directory with:

```
sudo mv .config .themes wallpaper /home/YOURUSERNAMEHERE
```

4. Install the listed fonts. (You can find them in the ```Required Fonts``` file.)
5. Set up zsh (Optional)
6. Change your GTK theme and icons (Using GTK-look/nwg-look or the terminal)


## Extra configuration
There is a few optional configurations and alts in the .config directory (waybar borders etc.) Feel free to alter whatever you want to make it your own style. ðŸ¥°

You can also changed your desired Wallpaper directory in .config/waypaper/config.ini

For the Theme to work in certain GTK apps, you might need to add the theme's assets diretory to ~/.config/assets
